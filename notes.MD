## Bellman Equation
- Optimal value from a state is the maximum value of all possible actions from that state
## Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
### Non-Deterministic
- sometimes event not in control of the agent happens
### Deterministic Search

### Markov process
- probability of each state transition depends only on the current state and action
### Markov decision processes
- Mathematical framework for modeling decision-making
